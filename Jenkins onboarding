Why Point 3 is Required
Point 3 refers to the requirement that "XFT must be willing for a charge back with valid BP ID and that gets interlocked with the onboarding request in product funnel."

This is required because it ensures that the costs associated with running Jenkins on AWS (such as compute resources, storage, etc.) are 
allocated correctly within the 
organization. A BP (Billing Point) ID is
used to track these costs and charge them
to the appropriate department or project
budget. This helps in maintaining financial
accountability and ensuring that the expenses are attributed 
to the correct team or project.

Contact Finance or Administration:

Reach out to your finance or administration department. They are usually responsible for managing BP IDs and can provide you with the necessary information or create a new BP ID for your project if needed.
